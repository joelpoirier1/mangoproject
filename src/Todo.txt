Currently:
-Utilize Kacper's microservice
-Merge Farrukh's and Annelyse's code
-Function that retrieves all the comments in the model

After event sourcing merged and comments can be created on mango:
-Add ArrayList of childComments to implement nested comments
-Add userID into comment
-Take care of the parentID stuff in CommentCreateDTO
