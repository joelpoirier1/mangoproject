Currently:
-Wait for Alyssa to check the code
-Retrieve comment events one by one from the event store
-Function that retrieves all the comments in the model

After event sourcing merged and comments can be created on mango:
-Add ArrayList of childComments to implement nested comments
-Add userID into comment
-Take care of the parentID stuff in CommentCreateDTO
